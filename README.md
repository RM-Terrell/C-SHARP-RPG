# C-SHARP-RPG
Requires .NET framework to be installed in order to run. Was built using Visual Studio, following the guide of Scott Lilly found here: http://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/
As of Feb 2017 I am attempting to update the game with more of my own work and expand it. Will push updates to GitHub as they are completed.
