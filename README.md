# C-SHARP-RPG
As one of my first ventures in C# (and an OOP language in general) I started building this simple RPG game with the guidance of a guide built by [Scott Lilly](https://github.com/ScottLilly) found [here](http://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/). I had never built out a large project of this sort in any programming language and was also very new to Visual Studio. As such this was as much an adventure in learning the basics of Visual Studio as it was C#.

# Running the Game
An executable version of the game is coming soon, but in the mean time only Visual Studio is required to run the code.
